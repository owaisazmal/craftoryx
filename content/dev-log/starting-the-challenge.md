# Starting the 10 Apps in 12 Months Challenge

Welcome to **CraftoryX**—a personal challenge to ship 10 production-ready iOS apps to the App Store in just 12 months.

## Why This Challenge?

As an iOS developer, I've always wanted to push my limits and ship real products. This challenge is about more than just coding—it's about:

- **🚀 Shipping consistently**: Moving from idea to App Store
- **📚 Learning in public**: Sharing wins, failures, and lessons
- **💼 Building a portfolio**: 10 real apps with real users
- **⚡ Mastering Swift**: Deep diving into SwiftUI, Combine, CoreML, and more

## The Rules

1. **Swift only**: All apps built with Swift and native iOS frameworks
2. **Ship to App Store**: Each app must be publicly available
3. **Weekly updates**: Transparent dev logs every week
4. **Quality bar**: Each app must be polished and accessible
5. **One year deadline**: August 31, 2026

## What's Next

I'm starting with **FocusFlow**, a Pomodoro timer app. It's simple enough to ship quickly but has room for interesting features like ambient soundscapes and analytics.

Follow along as I document every step of the journey. The good, the bad, and the rejected by App Store review.

**Let's build something amazing.**
